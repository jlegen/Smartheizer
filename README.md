 basic heating control

 I wanted some more control for my ancient heating system:
 * enable heating remotely before returning from holidays in winter :-)
 * record activity of heating system and hot water preparation
 * embed into my <a href="https://iobroker.net"> iobroker</a> system

 The hardware in short:

* provides 3 isolated inputs for recording operation times (oil burner, pumps, hot water preparation)
* 3 relays to control heating operations, night setback remotely
* 3 plugs for DS18B20 temperature sensors
* socket for Wemos D1 Mini (or Pro)
* runs with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/"> Tasmota</a>
